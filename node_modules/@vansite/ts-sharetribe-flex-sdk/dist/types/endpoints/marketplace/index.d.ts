/**
 * @fileoverview Client for the Sharetribe Marketplace API.
 *
 * This is the main entry point for client-side applications.
 * Provides access to all public and authenticated endpoints:
 * - Listings, bookings, messages, reviews
 * - Current user management (signup, profile, password)
 * - Image uploads, Stripe payments
 * - Availability & stock queries
 *
 * Use `sdk.marketplace` for all frontend or authenticated user flows.
 *
 * @example
 * const sdk = new SharetribeSdk({ clientId: "abc123" });
 *
 * // Fetch current user
 * const { data: user } = await sdk.marketplace.currentUser.show();
 *
 * // Query public listings
 * const { data: listings } = await sdk.marketplace.listings.query({ perPage: 20 });
