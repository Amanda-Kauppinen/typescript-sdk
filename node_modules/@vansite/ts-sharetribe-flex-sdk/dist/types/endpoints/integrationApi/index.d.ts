/**
 * @fileoverview Client for the Sharetribe Integration API.
 *
 * This is the main entry point for server-side or trusted integrations.
 * It provides access to all privileged endpoints: availability exceptions, events,
 * image uploads, stock management, transactions, users, and more.
 *
 * Requires a client secret for authentication.
 *
 * @example
 * const sdk = new IntegrationSdk({
 *   clientId: "abc123",
 *   clientSecret: "super-secret",
 *   baseUrl: "https://api.sharetribe.com"
 * });
 *
 * // Query recent events
 * const { data: events } = await sdk.integration.events.query({
 *   createdAtStart: "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
 * });
